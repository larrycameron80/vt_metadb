# VirusTotal Threat Intelligence Gathering Script

This script is used to sync-up with VirusTotal file/url feeds API and store meta-data of every submission to Virustotal in a MongoDB instance. This information can later be utilized for threat intelligence gathering.

This script is based on Emiliano Martinez example script used to interact with VirusTotal's
feeds APIs. The API is documented at: https://www.virustotal.com/documentation/private-api/

Please contact VirusTotal to obtain a Private API key for this script to function properly.
